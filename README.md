Odin-Recipes

This Project will be a basic "cookbook" with a few different recipes and images. The purpose of this project is to practice basic HTML markup and to get a feel for using git and github.

Original Recipes:

Bang Bang Chicken: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/273785/bang-bang-chicken/
Bang Bang Potatoes: https://www.allrecipes.com/bang-bang-potatoes-recipe-8551629
Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos: https://www.allrecipes.com/bang-bang-shrimp-tacos-recipe-11734357

I have now completed this project and have achieved my goal of practicing using HTML, git, and github. For now I will move on and hopefully come back to add css styling in the future.
