               These bang bang shrimp tacos take bang bang flavor to the next level. Fried shrimp is tossed in spicy mayo,
               sweet chili-Sriracha sauce, and nestled into tacos with crunchy red cabbage, onion, and avocado.

          </ul>
          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
               <li>
                    Gather all ingredients. 
               </li>
               <li>
                    Place shrimp in a bowl. Add buttermilk, garlic, salt, pepper, and onion powder; toss to coat. Let stand at
                    room temperature while preparing remaining ingredients, about 30 minutes.
               </li>
               <li>
                    For bang bang sauce, whisk mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, and Sriracha together in a large bowl.
               </li>
               <li>
                    Prepare cabbage, cilantro, avocado, and onion before beginning to cook. Place chopped onion in a fine mesh
                    sieve. Rinse under cold running water; drain (this makes the flavor less sharp). Blot dry with paper
                    towels; set aside.
               </li>
               <li>
                    Heat corn tortillas, 1 at a time, on a dry skillet or griddle or directly on the grates of a gas burner
                    over medium heat, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Stack tortillas as they are done and place between a folded
                    sheet of foil to steam and keep warm. For flour tortillas, wrap in a damp paper towel and heat in the
                    microwave 30 seconds. 
               </li>
               <li>
                    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drain shrimp, and discard marinade. Dredge shrimp, in 2
                    batches, in cornstarch to coat, shaking off excess.  
               </li>
               <li>
                    Fry shrimp, in 2 batches, until opaque, 3 to 4 minutes, turning once, adding additional oil as needed. 
               </li>
               <li>
                    Place cooked shrimp in the bowl with bang bang sauce; toss to coat. 
               </li>
               <li>
                    Divide cabbage between warm tortillas. Top with shrimp, cilantro, avocado, and white onion. Spoon any
                    extra Bang Bang sauce over the top. Serve with lime wedges.
               </li>
